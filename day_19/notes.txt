object:
   -it is a collection of related data and functions
   -it is a collction of properties and methods
   -it is a collection of avriables and functions
   -it indicates real time entity

   ex: 
      dog:
         properties/variables/data:name,age,color,breed,height
         actions/behavior/functions/methods:barking,eating,running,jumping

         function dog(variable_1,variable_2){
            this.name=variable_1;
            this.color=variable_2;
            this.propertyName=variableName;

            function barking(){

            }

         }
Note:In js every object has a prototype
--------------------------------------------------------------
prototype:
     -it is a property of an object
     -it allows other object to inherit properties and methods
     -it is used to add new properties and methods to an object
     -this created a prototype chain between objects
                      :allows objects to share propeties and methods
