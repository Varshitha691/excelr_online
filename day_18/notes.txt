what are call back functions
      --it is a function that is passed as an argument to another function

callback hell--(pyramid of doom)
----------------------------------
    - it is a situation where we have multiple callbacks inside a callback(nested callbacks)
    -hard to read
    -hard to maintain/modify
    -hard to debug
    -this usually happens when we have to perform multiple asynchronous operations

--------------------------------------------------------
promises:
+++++++++++++++++++
  - a promise is in js is an object that represents the outcome of asynchronous operations
  -it is used to handle the sucess and  failure of asynchronous operation
  -states in promises:
     1.pending-initial state
     2.fulfilled-the operation was sucessful
     3.rejected-the operation failed
then()function:
- we can use then()function to handle the success and failure of a promise
-we can use catch() function to handle the failure of a promise
-we can use finally() function to handle the success and failure of a promise

------------------------------------------------------------
async&await functios:
+++++++++++++++
async:

  async functions are functions that return a promise
  async functions are used to handle asynchronous operations

syntax:

async function functionName(){

}

await:
++++++++++++++++++++++

   await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve
   await is used inside an async function
   it will make the code synchronous

syntax:

async function functionName(){
    await functionName();
}


authentication:
success:welcome user
        update user
        delete user
        profile
failure:login failed

-------------------------------------------
Promise.all()
    -it is used to wait for all the promises to resolve
    -it returns a promise
    -it is used to handle multiple promises(asynchronous operations)
    -if all sucessful it returns an array of values
    -if any one fails it returns an errors

---------------------------------------------------
Promise.race()
  -it is used to wait for the first promise to resolve
  -it returns a promise
  -it is used to handle multiple promises(asynchronous operations)
------------------------------------------------------
Promise.allSettled()
   -it is used to wait for all promises to resolve
   -it returns a promise
   -it is used to handle multiple promises(asynchronous operations)
   -wait for all promises and tells
                1.which one success
                2.which one is fails
-------------------------------------------------------------
feature                 .all               .race                  .allSettled
wait for all promises   yes                 no                     yes
fails fast             on first reject    if first rejects        never fails
use case               all must succeed   first win                get all outcomes
return                 array              first value              all results with status
---------------------------------------------------
JQuery:
   JQuery is fast,small js library
   use:dom manipulation
       event handling
       animation
       ajax(api -http requests)
    --it is easier when compared with js
